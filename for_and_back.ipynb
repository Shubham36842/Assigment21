    "Each connection between neurons in consecutive layers of a neural network has an associated weight. These weights determine the strength of the connections and are essential in adjusting the importance of different inputs to produce the desired output.\n",

    "The softmax function is commonly used in the output layer of a neural network, especially in multi-class classification problems.

    "Interpretability:\n",

    "Decision Making:\n",
    "\n",
